# 🧠 selfScope — Terminal Self Check-In & Identity Profiler

**selfScope** is a sarcastic little Python app that asks you some very personal questions in the most passive-aggressive way possible — all through your terminal.

It’s part mood tracker, part roast session, part beginner coding project. You enter your name, age, height, and current vibe... and `selfScope` responds with a delightful mix of validation, judgment, and semi-useful feedback.

## 🎯 What It Does

- Asks for your **name**, and makes sure it’s not “1234” or “?!@#”
- Checks your **age**, reacts accordingly (especially if you’re ancient or unborn)
- Analyzes your **height** in cm and provides unsolicited commentary
- Asks how you’re **feeling** and pretends to care
- Prints a short **summary** at the end like a therapist... but coded by a sleep-deprived student

---

## 🧪 Skills & Tech Used

- Python 3.x
- `input()`, `print()`, `while` loops
- Conditional statements (`if/elif/else`)
- String methods like `.isalpha()` and `.isdigit()`
- Basic number validation and range checks
- Zero external libraries — just you and the default Python sadness
